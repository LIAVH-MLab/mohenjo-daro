The entrance to the<br>well-room at this time was probably<br>from the west though that wall<br>was badly damaged and the actual<br>position of the door could not<br>be ascertained. Against the eastern part<br>of the southern wall of this<br>well-room at the level \u2014 13.6<br>ft. were the remains of an<br>unusually fine pavement of two courses<br>of bricks 10.4 X 5.35x2 ins.<br>in size, laid on a 3<br>ft. 4 ins. thick layer of<br>kiln-refuse, which in turn rested on<br>a stratum of ash about half<br>an inch thick. This pavement was<br>carefully bordered with bricks set on<br>their shorter edges so as to<br>project 5-5 ins. above the floor<br>level. I do not think that<br>this thick layer of pottery kiln-refuse<br>was intended to drain the room;<br>it was merely used as a<br>convenient filling which would not be<br>liable to settle. Similar material was<br>quite frequently used for the foundations<br>of walls, especially in the Late<br>Period", "<b>Well</b><br>In House V a large expanse<br>of pavement round the well was<br>divided into two portions by a<br>thin partition wall, east of which<br>the pavement was 6 ins. lower<br>than on the west.

Though at that time water<br>must have been obtained from the<br>well, 2 ft. 3 ins. in<br>diameter, in the north-eastern corner of<br>the building, we only know that<br>the steening of the well was<br>raised from the level-9.9 ft. to<br>-7.9 ft. to bring it once<br>more into use; the floor and<br>doorways of the well-room during Late<br>II days had completely disappeared. In<br>the Late Ib Phase, the steening<br>of this well was raised again<br>to the level-4.2 ft., and a<br>very carefully laid pavement (PI. XLIII,<br>f) round it at the level<br>- 6 ft. bears ample testimony<br>to the constant use of the<br>well ; a number of depressions<br>were worn deep into the floor<br>by the constant dumping of the<br>water-jars.
