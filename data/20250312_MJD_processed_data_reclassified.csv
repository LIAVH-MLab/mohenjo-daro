12,,7,1,,-7.2,,Foundation,,"House I, which was 40 ft. N.-S., by 36 ft. E.-W., was exceptionally well built, though none of its massive walls rested on masonry of earlier date. The average level to which its foundations reached was 7.2 ft. below datum, and in places its walls still stood some 3 ft. high. The bricks used in their construction were 11x 5 X 2 • 25 ins. in size. Its interior proved most uninteresting ; not one of the rooms was paved, though it is possible that brick floors that once existed were removed in still later times.

73,079-024-X,7,2,93,-21.4,Early Periods,Animals,Model animal,"Steatite. Well-carved model of a bull, whose separately made horns and ears were fixed in sockets and may have been of another material. Other sockets served for the attachment of the sexual organs, and the tail which lay in a groove between the buttocks. A larger hole between the legs suggests that this figure was supported on a stand. The wrinkles and hair on head and neck, and the garland round the latter had been carefully owrked with a graver. The eyes may not have been inlaid as the sockets are very shallow. The figurine seems not to have been glazed, but merely coated with a white slip like that on teh seals.

300,073-004-X,7,2,89,-7.3,Late III,Human Figure,Figurine,"Pottery, with traces of a dark red slip or wash. On the head of this female figurine there are patches of a white concretion which looks like the remains of a stucco covering. If it were thus originally plastered, it would be like No. 3 above. This white coating now only remains around the face, and the stucco may have been quite local. The eyes are very elongated and horizontally set, the nose very prominently pinched up. The mouth is indicated in the usual way by indenting a strip of clay to form the lips. The fan-shaped portion of the head-dress is more than usually upstanding, and the pannier-like objects on each side of the head are partly hidden from the front view by various supporting bands which were ornamented by pellets of clay, intended perhaps to represent medallions. The ends of two of these strips are brought so far forward on each side of the face as partially to obscure the features. The interiors of both panniers are stained black. This is somewhat roughly made figurine, though evidently the work of experienced hands.

19,,7,2,,,,Stair Tread,,"The passage-like vestibule 92, 93 was entered from the east by a doorway at the southern end of the lane 39. This entrance was, however, blocked up by a thin wall in the Late Ib Phase. The well-preserved stairway at the western end of this vestibule (93) was 3 ft. 11 ins. wide, and its seven treads which averaged 8• 25 ins.in breadth by  8-5ins.high were built of bricks measuring 9• 75X4- 25X
2-25 ins. (PI. XLVIII, a). Judging from its base-length, 25 ft. 10 ins., this stair- way must have been a considerable height ; allowing for a landing, 4-5 ft. square, at its eastern end, it would have risen at least 15 ft. Like most of the staircases at jVIohenjo-daro it was very solidly built, except at its eastern end (91) where there was a rubble filling. It appears that this staircase led to a separate self-contained flat above, which must have enjoyed absolute privacy. For after the closing of the doorway that existed for a time between the passage and room 89. the former led solely to the stairway, which could only be reached by traversing the whole length ofthepassage. Thelane,moreover,fromwhichthepassagewasenteredwas, in its latter days at any rate, a cul-de-sac. Room 29 and the stairway in the pas- sage 92, 93 were probably built at the latter end of the Late III Phase.

This model is especially valuable, in that it it furnishes a proof that the fowl was domesticated at Mohenjo-daro; which after all is not surpisring, since the domestic fowl, now bred all over the world, is supposed to have orifinated in India.
