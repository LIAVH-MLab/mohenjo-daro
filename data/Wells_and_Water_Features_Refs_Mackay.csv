The jar was not holed as a drainage jar would have been, and it was well made and coated on the outside with a thick red slip which would prevent percolation.",,"PI.

Shallow cavities in this pavement worn by the dumping of numberless water-jars show that this well-room was in frequent use throughout a lengthy period, and its separate entrance from the lane to the south suggests that the owner of the house freely allowed his neighbours access to his well.
